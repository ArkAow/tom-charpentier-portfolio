                            Throughout my studies, I have gained extensive experience in various programming languages and development tools. 
                            My academic journey has allowed me to acquire strong foundational skills in software development, with a focus on 
                            three key areas: software development, mobile application development, and web development.
                            <br/><br/>
                            This versatile skill set enables me to adapt to diverse project requirements and to collaborate effectively within 
                            multidisciplinary teams. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in 
                            technology to provide innovative solutions and deliver high-quality work.
                            <br/><br/>

                        In the meantime, I have had the opportunities to work with several companies, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in a professional environment. 
                        Through these roles, I was able to apply my technical skills, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and gain insights into industry practices and workflows.
